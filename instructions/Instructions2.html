    Instructions: Consumption

{% block content %}

<p>To survive from one month to the next, you must consume 1 unit of Food each month.</p>

<p>There are two ways to meet this requirement:</p>
<ol>
    <li>By purchasing Food: You buy at least 1 unit during the current month.</li>
    <li>From Food Reserves: You already have Food stored from earlier months.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you neither have any Food in Reserves nor buy any Food during the month, you do not survive, and the round ends.</p>

<hr>

<p>Each month, you have the option to buy Food at the current price listed in the "Information" section.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You will consume 1 unit of Food per month.</li>
    <li>Food is nonperishable, so any units you buy in excess of 1 are stored as Food Reserves and carried over to future months.</li>
    <li>If you already have Food in Reserves, you can choose not to buy any more.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not required to start a month with Food in your Reserves.  
As long as you buy at least 1 unit during the current month, you will survive to the next.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If you have 3 units in Food Reserves, you can survive 3 months without buying anything.</li>
    <li>If the month number + your Food Reserves = 13, you will survive until the end of the round.</li>
</ul>
