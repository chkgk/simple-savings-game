    Instructions: Consumption

{% block content %}

<p>To survive from one month to the next, you must consume 1 unit of food each month.</p>

<p>There are two ways to meet this requirement:</p>
<ol>
    <li>By purchasing food: You buy at least 1 unit during the current month.</li>
    <li>From food reserves: You have leftover food stored from earlier months.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you neither have any food in reserves nor buy any food during the month, you do not survive, and the round ends.</p>

<p>Each month, you have the option to buy food at the current price listed in the "Salary & Prices" section of the decision screen. Please note:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You will consume 1 unit of food per month automatically.</li>
    <li>Food is nonperishable, so any units you buy in excess of 1 are stored as food reserves and carried over to future months.</li>
    <li>If you already have food in reserves, you can choose not to buy any additional units.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not required to start a month with food in your reserves.  
As long as you buy at least 1 unit during the current month, you will survive to the next.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> If you have 3 units of food in reserves, you can survive 3 months without buying anything.</p>
