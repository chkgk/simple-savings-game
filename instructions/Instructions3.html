<p>Cash that is not spent on food is available for investing in an asset. The asset pays for every $1, either $1,60 or $0,75 with equal probability (50%) each month. That means that your total investment is either multiplied by 1,6 or 0,75. If you want to invest cash into the asset, you need to actively specify how much of your available cash you want to dedicate to the asset every month.</p>

<p>After each month, it is indicated which pay-off is realized and what your total asset payment is. That information is illustrated under the “History” section on the game screen.</p>

<p>Everything that won’t be invested in the asset will be kept in cash and pays 1.9% interest every month. Therefore, the cash balance at the end of the month, after all expenses, is multiplied by 1,019. The information on how much interest you earned in total in the previous period is also visible in the "History" section of the game screen under "Interest Payment".</p>
