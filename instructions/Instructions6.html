<p><b>Remuneration</b><br>
    As mentioned in the introduction, you have the chance to receive a payment based on your performance in the
    Simple Savings Game.</p>

<p>If you are among those participants randomly selected to receive a payment, the performance-based pay depends on your final amount of cash. Since you play
    over two rounds, the final cash balance of one of the two rounds is randomly selected to be paid out.</p>

<p>Note: If the game ends prematurely because you do not have any food reserves and do not have enough cash to purchase the required unit of food, the final amount of your cash recorded in this round will be $ 0.</p>
