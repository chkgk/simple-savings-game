<p><strong>Remuneration</strong><br>
As mentioned in the Introduction, you have the chance to receive study remuneration based on your performance in the Simple Savings Game.</p>

<p>The performance-based remuneration depends on your final value of Cash in the Simple Savings Game. Since you play over two rounds, the final Cash balance of one of the two rounds is randomly selected to determine remuneration.</p>

<p>Additionally, for successfully passing comprehension questions and practice tasks, you will earn 4€. You will also answer follow-up questions and enter lotteries after the game, which contribute to your total earnings.</p>

<p>Of all participants, 10% are randomly selected and will receive remuneration for their involvement.</p>

<p>Note: If the game ends because you do not have at least 1 unit of Food in your reserves, the final Cash value for that round will be 0$. However, you can still earn remuneration from the second round and the questionnaires.</p>

<p><strong>Conversion</strong><br>
The game’s currency is denominated in dollars ($). There is a conversion rate of <em>10$ = 1€</em>. That means if the final Cash balance is 80$, you will receive 8€. All earnings in euros are added together for your total remuneration.</p>
