<p>First, I will explain the mechanics of the experiment called “Simple Savings Game”.</p>

<p>The game is structured in two rounds. Each round consists of twelve months. In total, you will play for 24 months. Both rounds start with an initial cash balance of $30.00, and you receive an income of $8.00 every month. You then have different possibilities to use that available cash every month.</p>

<p>There are two different saving options and one consumption opportunity. You can either invest your cash into a risky asset whose payoff varies and is randomly determined each month, or you have the option to save money as cash, which pays you interest. Additionally, for consumption, you can buy food. After every month, one unit of food is consumed. If you don’t have enough food for consumption, the round ends prematurely.</p>

<p>As you go through the following pages, I will ask you questions or have you perform certain tasks related to the Simple Savings Game to confirm you understand the game's mechanics and rules.</p>
